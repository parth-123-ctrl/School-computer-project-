  <p>Exposure to air pollution can affect everyone's health. When we breathe in air pollutants, they can enter our bloodstream and contribute to coughing or itchy eyes and cause or worsen many breathing and lung diseases, leading to hospitalizations, cancer, or even premature death.</p>
  <p>Pollution significantly impacts both animals and humans, causing a range of health problems and ecosystem damage. Air pollution can lead to respiratory issues, heart disease, and even cancer in both species, while water pollution can cause various ailments like cholera and gastrointestinal disorders. Exposure to chemicals in soil and food can also lead to long-term health risks, including organ damage and developmental issues. Animals suffer from similar effects, including respiratory problems, skin irritations, and reduced reproductive success, as well as disruptions to their behavior and habitats.</p>
