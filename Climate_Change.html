  <p> Climate change affects disease spread by altering temperature and weather patterns, leading to increases in vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, and by causing extreme weather events that can disrupt healthcare and increase disease transmission. Warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation can expand the geographic range of disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks, increasing the risk of exposure in areas where these diseases were previously uncommon.  </p>
