  <p> Hygiene, vaccination, and biodiversity all play crucial roles in maintaining health. Hygiene, like handwashing, is a cost-effective way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, while vaccination protects against specific illnesses by stimulating the immune system. Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, provides essential ecosystem services like clean water and food, and also plays a role in regulating disease and climate, impacting human health.</p>
